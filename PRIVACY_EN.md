# Privacy Policy

This policy describes how the project processes user data and ensures
the security of information storage.

## 1. General Provisions

-   The repository is intended solely for demonstration and development
    of bot functionality and smart contracts.
-   The code is open source and available for review. You can verify
    that there are no hidden features or data transfers to third
    parties.

## 2. User Data

-   The bot uses the Telegram identifier (ID) and username exclusively
    for system identification.
-   When creating a crypto wallet, a **seed phrase** is generated,
    encrypted, and stored in the database in an encrypted form.
-   Neither seed phrases nor private keys are transmitted to third
    parties or stored in plain text.

## 3. Encryption and Security

-   All sensitive data (seed phrases, access keys) are encrypted with
    AES-256.
-   Blockchain connections are made through secure RPC providers.
-   Transactions are signed locally and cannot be altered by third-party
    services.

## 4. Data Usage

-   Data is used solely to ensure the operation of the bot:
    -   Creating and managing crypto wallets.
    -   Executing USDT and BNB transactions.
    -   Crediting referral rewards.
-   The project does not use data for advertising or transfer it to
    third parties.

## 5. Transparency and Open Source

-   All project code is open for review.
-   Any user can verify that data is not transferred to third-party
    services.

## 6. User Responsibility

-   Users are responsible for securely storing their own data (seed
    phrases and keys).
-   Losing a seed phrase means losing access to funds. The project team
    has no technical ability to recover such data.

## 7. Feedback

If you have questions about security or privacy, please create an Issue
in the GitHub repository or contact the project author.
